# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide ðŸ”§

## Current Issue: Site Can't Be Reached
The live domain trantortournaments.org is showing "ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED" which indicates a deployment connectivity issue.

## Possible Causes

### 1. Deployment Not Updated
- The live site may still have the old version
- Recent multi-domain changes haven't been deployed
- Need to trigger a fresh deployment

### 2. DNS Configuration Issues
- Domain may not be properly pointing to Replit deployment
- SSL certificate issues
- CDN or proxy configuration problems

### 3. Replit Deployment Status
- Deployment may have stopped or crashed
- Resource limits exceeded
- Build or startup errors

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Re-Deploy Current Version
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit interface
2. Select trantortournaments.org as the deployment domain
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Test the live site

### Option 2: Check Deployment Logs
1. Go to Replit Deployments tab
2. Check for error messages or failed builds
3. Review deployment logs for connectivity issues
4. Restart deployment if needed

### Option 3: DNS Verification
```bash
# Check if domain resolves correctly
nslookup trantortournaments.org

# Check SSL certificate
curl -I https://trantortournaments.org
```

## Expected Working State

After successful deployment, the site should:
- Load instantly without authentication loops
- Show tournament platform with guest access banner
- Display Champions for Change branding (blue theme)
- Allow viewing tournaments without login
- Hide all fantasy content (domain separation working)

## Fallback Access Methods

While fixing the live deployment:

### 1. Replit Preview URL
- Use the preview URL provided in the Replit interface
- May not work from school districts (OAuth blocked)
- Good for testing and development

### 2. Alternative Domains
Once fixed, the multi-domain system provides:
- **tournaments.trantortournaments.org** - School-safe platform
- **fantasy.trantortournaments.org** - Adult fantasy sports
- **pro.trantortournaments.org** - Professional features

**Platform Status**
- Development: Working in Replit environment
- Deployment: Needs update/restart
- Domain: trantortournaments.org (needs DNS/deployment fix)

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Trigger fresh deployment to trantortournaments.org
2. **VERIFY**: Test site loads and shows school-safe content
3. **CONFIGURE**: Set up subdomain separation for fantasy/pro domains
4. **TEST**: Verify guest access works from school networks
5. **MONITOR**: Check deployment stability and performance

The platform is fully built and working - we just need to get the deployment updated with the latest multi-domain separation features.
