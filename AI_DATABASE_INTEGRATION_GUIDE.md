# AI Database Integration Guide ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¾

## Overview

Comprehensive AI contextual help system that references live tournament data to provide personalized assistance. Built using your Claude's superior architecture recommendations - smart AI fields in existing database schema instead of separate AI tables.

## System Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema

#### User AI Context Fields
```typescript
// Added to existing users table
aiPreferences: jsonb("ai_preferences").$type<{
  wantsProactiveHelp: boolean;
  communicationStyle: 'friendly' | 'professional' | 'technical';
  helpLevel: 'minimal' | 'guided' | 'comprehensive';
  hasCompletedOnboarding: boolean;
}>(),

techSkillLevel: text("tech_skill_level", {
  enum: ["beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"]
}).default("intermediate"),

completedAITutorials: jsonb("completed_ai_tutorials").$type<string[]>(),
aiInteractionCount: integer("ai_interaction_count").default(0),
```

#### Tournament AI Context Fields
```typescript
// Added to existing tournaments table
aiSetupProgress: jsonb("ai_setup_progress").$type<{
  donationModuleStep: 'not_started' | 'suggested' | 'creating' | 'stripe_setup' | 'testing' | 'complete';
  stripeAccountStatus: 'unknown' | 'none' | 'creating' | 'has_account' | 'keys_added' | 'validated';
  lastAIInteraction: string;
  completedSteps: string[];
  userResponses: Record<string, any>;
}>(),

aiContext: jsonb("ai_context").$type<{
  userTechLevel: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  preferredCommunicationStyle: 'detailed' | 'concise' | 'visual';
  hasAskedForHelp: boolean;
  previousQuestions: string[];
  successfulSetups: number;
}>(),

setupAssistanceLevel: text("setup_assistance_level", {
  enum: ["minimal", "standard", "full_guidance", "expert_mode"]
}).default("standard"),

donationSetupData: jsonb("donation_setup_data").$type<{
  goal: number;
  purpose: string;
  description: string;
  suggestedAmounts: number[];
  stripePublicKey?: string;
  stripeAccountId?: string;
  setupStartedAt?: string;
  setupCompletedAt?: string;
}>(),
```

### 2. AIContextService

Smart service that generates contextual responses based on live user data:

```typescript
export class AIContextService {
  async getAIContext(userId: string, tournamentId?: string): Promise<AIContext>
  async generateContextualResponse(context: AIContext, userQuestion: string): Promise<string>
  async generateSuggestions(context: AIContext, userQuestion: string): Promise<AISuggestion[]>
  async updateAIProgress(tournamentId: string, progress: any): Promise<void>
}
```

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Enhanced AI Chat with Database Context
```
POST /api/ai/contextual-help
- References user's tournament history
- Adjusts response based on experience level
- Tracks conversation for continuous improvement
```

#### Proactive AI Suggestions
```
GET /api/ai/proactive-suggestions/:tournamentId
- Analyzes tournament state
- Suggests missing features (donations, registration fees)
- Provides optimization recommendations
```

#### AI Context Retrieval
```
GET /api/ai/context/:userId
- Returns comprehensive user/tournament context
- Used for personalization and analytics
```

## Smart Response Examples

### Beginner User (0 successful setups)
**Question:** "Help me set up Stripe"
**AI Response:** "I'll walk you through Stripe step by step! Stripe is a payment processor that lets you accept donations safely. Since this is your first time, I'll give you detailed instructions with screenshots. Ready to start?"

### Experienced User (5+ successful setups)
**Question:** "Help me set up Stripe"
**AI Response:** "I see you've set up donations 5 times before! Do you need your usual Stripe dashboard link, or are you running into a specific issue?"

### Goal Setting with History
**Question:** "What donation goal should I set?"
**AI Response:** "Based on your previous tournaments (average goal: $750), I'd suggest setting a goal between $600 and $900 for this basketball tournament. What are your main expenses this time?"

## Proactive Suggestions

### Missing Donation Module
```typescript
{
  type: 'donation_setup',
  priority: 'high',
  title: 'Add Donation Module',
  message: `I noticed "Spring Basketball Tournament" doesn't have donations enabled yet. Most basketball tournaments raise $500+ to help with expenses. Want me to set this up?`,
  action: 'setup_donations'
}
```

### Revenue Optimization
```typescript
{
  type: 'revenue_optimization',
  priority: 'medium',
  title: 'Consider Registration Fees',
  message: 'Adding a small registration fee ($10-25) can help cover tournament costs and reduce your donation goal.',
  action: 'setup_registration_fees'
}
```

### Onboarding for New Users
```typescript
{
  type: 'onboarding',
  priority: 'medium',
  title: 'Tournament Setup Tutorial',
  message: 'Since this is your first tournament, would you like a guided tour of all the features?',
  action: 'start_tutorial'
}
```
