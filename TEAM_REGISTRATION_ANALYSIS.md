# Team Registration System Analysis & Implementation

## The Jersey Watch Problem You Identified

### **Current Pain Points:**
1. **Individual Registration Hell**: Each player registers separately → manual team assembly → document chaos
2. **Payment Fragmentation**: Parents pay individually → hard to track team completion
3. **Document Nightmare**: Each parent uploads docs separately → approval bottleneck
4. **Tournament Director Overload**: Manual matching of players to teams in external systems

### **Your Proposed Solution:**
**Team-Based Registration Flow:** Coach creates team → Players join team → Collective payment → Document management → Bulk approval

## Messaging vs Tournament Management Pricing Impact

### **Jersey Watch Model Analysis:**
- **Tier Based on Messages**: 500 emails + 509 texts = messaging-centric pricing
- **Our Current Model**: Tournament-centric (Foundation/Champion/Enterprise)

### **Key Decision: Do We Add Messaging?**

**If YES - Add Messaging Capabilities:**
- Team notifications (roster updates, game times, weather alerts)  
- Parent communications (payment reminders, document requests)
- Tournament announcements (schedule changes, results)
- **Pricing Impact**: Might need usage-based tiers or messaging limits

**If NO - Keep Tournament-Focused:**
- Teams use external messaging (GroupMe, email, text)
- We focus on tournament management excellence
- **Pricing Impact**: No change needed
