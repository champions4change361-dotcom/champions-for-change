## API Workflow Examples

### Creating a Tournament
```javascript
// Step 1: Get available sports
const sports = await bubble.api.get("/api/sports");

// Step 2: Filter by category if needed
const teamSports = sports.filter(sport => 
  sport.SportCategory === "Team Sports"
);

// Step 3: Get sport-specific configuration
const selectedSport = sports.find(sport => 
  sport.SportName === "Basketball"
);

// Step 4: Configure tournament based on sport
const tournamentConfig = {
  TournamentName: "Spring Basketball Championship",
  TeamSize: 16,
  Sport: selectedSport.id,
  CompetitionFormat: selectedSport.CompetitionType, // bracket-to-series
  SeriesLength: 7, // Best of 7 for championship
  AgeGroup: "Adult",
  GenderDivision: "Mixed"
};

// Step 5: Create tournament
const tournament = await bubble.api.post("/api/tournaments", tournamentConfig);
```

### Building Tournament Pages
```javascript
// Page structure for tournament creation
const tournamentPageElements = {
  "sport_dropdown": {
    "type": "dropdown",
    "data_source": "SportOptions",
    "display_field": "SportName", 
    "group_by": "SportCategory",
    "filter": "IsActive = yes"
  },
  "competition_format_group": {
    "type": "radio_group",
    "options": "dynamic", // Based on selected sport's CompetitionType
    "conditional_logic": {
      "show_when": "selected_sport.CompetitionType = 'both'"
    }
  },
  "series_length_dropdown": {
    "type": "dropdown",
    "options": [
      {"value": 3, "text": "Best of 3 (first to 2 wins)"},
      {"value": 5, "text": "Best of 5 (first to 3 wins)"},
      {"value": 7, "text": "Best of 7 (first to 4 wins)"}
    ],
    "conditional_logic": {
      "show_when": "competition_format in ['series', 'bracket-to-series']"
    }
  },
  "team_size_dropdown": {
    "type": "dropdown", 
    "options": [4, 8, 16, 32],
    "default": 8
  }
};
```

## AI Training Prompts and Responses

### Example 1: Sport Selection
**User**: "I want to create a basketball tournament"

**AI Response**: 
```
I'll help you create a basketball tournament. Basketball uses a "bracket-to-series" format, which means:

1. **Stage 1**: Playoff brackets (elimination rounds)
2. **Stage 2**: Championship series (best-of format)

This is the same format used by professional leagues like the NBA. 

Configuration options:
- Tournament format: Bracket + Championship Series
- Series length: Best of 3, 5, or 7 games
- Team size: 4, 8, 16, or 32 teams
- Age groups: Youth, Adult, Masters, or All Ages

Would you like me to set up the tournament structure?
```

### Example 2: Competition Format Explanation
**User**: "What's the difference between bracket and bracket-to-series?"

**AI Response**:
```
Great question! Here are the key differences:

**Bracket Tournament:**
- Single-elimination format
- One game/match eliminates teams
- Used for: Football, Soccer, Tennis, Wrestling
- Example: March Madness basketball

**Bracket-to-Series:**  
- Two-stage format
- Stage 1: Playoff brackets (single games)
- Stage 2: Championship series (best-of format)
- Used for: NBA, MLB, NHL, professional volleyball
- Example: NBA playoffs â†’ NBA Finals (best of 7)

The bracket-to-series format is more realistic for professional sports where the championship is determined by a series rather than a single game.
```

### Example 3: Sport Category Guidance
**User**: "I need a tournament for a corporate hackathon"

**AI Response**:
```
Perfect! For a corporate hackathon, I recommend:

**Sport**: Hackathon (from Professional Services category)
**Format**: Leaderboard competition
**Scoring**: Points-based (judged on criteria like innovation, technical execution, presentation)

Setup suggestions:
- Competition type: Leaderboard (teams ranked by total score)
- Team size: 4-8 teams typical for hackathons
- Scoring criteria: Technical (40%), Innovation (30%), Presentation (20%), Business Value (10%)
- Duration: 24-48 hours typical

Would you like me to configure the scoring rubric and team registration process?
```
