I need help building a 5k community run for breast cancer awareness
8:28:50 PM
What an amazing initiative! Charity runs are such a beautiful way to bring communities together for a great cause! 💕

**I can help you organize a professional running event with:**
• Timing chip integration and results tracking
• Multiple distance options (5K, 10K, fun run, kids dash)
• Age group divisions and awards
• Registration management with online signup
• Safety coordination and course marshaling
• Donation collection and fundraising tools

**Let's plan your perfect running event:**
1. What distance(s) are you thinking? (5K, 10K, both?)
2. How many participants are you hoping to welcome?
3. What cause will this support?
4. Do you have a target date and location in mind?

Together we can create an event that makes a real difference! 🌟

The cause is breast cancer awareness there will be 760 participants. We will do it in the second Saturday in October 2025. We will also offer t-shirts. There is a $20 registration fee and we also need an option to donate to the cause. It will be called Corpus Christi Cares 5K. Neat name huh?
