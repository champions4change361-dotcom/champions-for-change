Great! You’re at the testing phase with a comprehensive tournament platform. Let me help you craft a prompt for Replit’s testing autonomy that will thoroughly stress-test your system.

Here’s a comprehensive testing prompt you can use:

-----

**COMPREHENSIVE TOURNAMENT PLATFORM TESTING PROMPT:**

“Please conduct thorough end-to-end testing of this tournament platform by creating and executing the following test scenarios. For each scenario, verify functionality, edge cases, and error handling:

**1. BASIC TOURNAMENT TYPES:**

- Create a single elimination tournament with 16 participants, run it to completion
- Create a double elimination tournament with 13 participants (odd number), verify loser’s bracket works correctly
- Create a round-robin tournament with 8 participants, ensure all pairings generate correctly
- Create a Swiss system tournament with 20 participants for 5 rounds, verify pairing algorithm prevents rematches

**2. EDGE CASES & STRESS TESTS:**

- Create tournaments with: 1 participant, 2 participants, 3 participants (odd), 127 participants (large odd), 128 participants (large even)
- Test mid-tournament participant dropout/disqualification in each tournament type
- Test late registration/adding participants after tournament starts
- Create tournaments with identical participant names to test ID handling
- Test simultaneous score submissions for the same match

**3. GROUP STAGE → KNOCKOUT:**

- Create a 16-team tournament with 4 groups of 4, then single elimination from top 2 of each group
- Verify tiebreaker logic within groups (head-to-head, goal difference, etc.)
- Test advancement logic to knockout stage

**4. SEEDING & PAIRING LOGIC:**

- Create tournaments with pre-seeded rankings (1-32) and verify bracket positions
- Test Swiss system color balancing (if applicable)
- Test Swiss system tiebreaker calculations (Buchholz, Sonneborn-Berger)
- Verify bye assignment in odd-participant tournaments

**5. SCORING SYSTEMS:**

- Test different scoring formats: best-of-3, best-of-5, aggregate scoring, point-based
- Submit invalid scores (negative, non-numeric, mismatched) and verify error handling
- Test score reversal/correction functionality
- Verify standing calculations update correctly after each result

**6. ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES:**

- Test tournament cloning/templating
- Test permission levels (organizer, referee, participant views)
- Test tournament modification after start (format change, participant removal)
- Test tournament cancellation and archiving

**7. CONCURRENT OPERATIONS:**

- Create multiple tournaments simultaneously
- Have the same participant in multiple active tournaments
- Submit scores for multiple matches concurrently
- Test database transaction integrity under load

**8. DATA VALIDATION & SECURITY:**

- Attempt SQL injection in tournament names, participant names
- Test XSS attempts in text fields
- Verify authentication/authorization for admin functions
- Test API rate limiting if applicable

**9. COMPLEX SCENARIOS:**

- Create a team-based Swiss tournament where individual results affect team standings
- Create a multi-stage tournament: qualification round-robin → playoff Swiss → final single elimination
- Test nested/hierarchical tournaments (regional qualifiers feeding into main event)

**10. UI/UX & EDGE CASES:**

- Test with extremely long tournament/participant names (>100 characters)
- Test special characters in names: O’Brien, José, 选手, emoji 🎮
- Verify mobile responsiveness of brackets and score entry
- Test print/export functionality for brackets

**REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:**
For each test, report:

- ✅ Success with any notable observations
- ❌ Failures with exact error messages and reproduction steps
- ⚠️ Warnings for unexpected behavior that didn’t break functionality
- 📊 Performance metrics for tournaments with 50+ participants

Focus especially on the Swiss system pairing algorithm, tiebreaker calculations, and any race conditions in concurrent score submissions. These are typically the most fragile areas.”

This prompt should give the testing agent a comprehensive workload that covers normal operations, edge cases, and stress scenarios. You can adjust the specifics based on what features you know you’ve implemented.

Would you like me to create a more focused prompt for any specific area, or help you set up automated test assertions?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
