Permitted Use
SRL believes in data democratization—open access to data and the tools that use it. Yes, we charge for some tools, but we strive to keep prices affordable for most users and to provide access to others, including underrepresented communities. Moreover, we encourage the sharing and reuse of data and statistics our users find on our Site as a general matter, but our business obviously would be harmed if a bad apple were to abuse that privilege to create a competing statistical database or to copy a materially significant portion of our data.

So, to strike an appropriate balance between these goals, and to protect our business, our technology infrastructure, and our ability to continue to provide interesting and robust sports statistics to our users, this section of our Agreements sets forth certain restrictions on permitted uses of this Site and its Content. Our guiding principles are that (1) sharing, using, modifying, repackaging, or publishing data found on individual SRL webpages is welcomed, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes, but (2) any such sharing, use, modification, repackaging, or publication should explicitly credit SRL as the source of the data to the maximum extent possible and (3) any such sharing, use, modification, repackaging, or publication must not violate any express restrictions set forth in this Section 6, especially the restrictions set forth in subparts 6(i) and 6(j) below.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you are granted a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use the Site and Content. However, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, in connection with your access and use of the Site, you may not:

alter or modify the Site; or
sell, rent, lease, transfer, provide, or otherwise assign to any third party any rights to the Site; or
remove or modify any proprietary notice or labels on the Site, or use any of our trademarks as meta-tags on any other website; or
use the Site for any non-authorized purpose or any illegal purpose; or
copy, modify, erase, or damage any information contained on computer servers used or controlled by SRL or any third party; or
use the Site to violate any legal right of any third party, including any publicity or privacy right, copyright, or other intellectual property right, or to take any action that is harassing, libelous, defamatory, abusive, tortious, threatening, harmful, or otherwise objectionable; or
access or use any password-protected, secure, or non-public areas of the Site, or access data on the Site not intended for you, except as specifically authorized by SRL; or
impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity; or
without our express written permission, use any automated means to access or use the Site, including scripts, bots, scrapers, data miners, or similar software, in a manner that adversely impacts site performance or access; or
use any material or Content from the Site, including without limitation any statistics or data, (i) to create any database, archive, or other data store that competes with or constitutes a material substitute for the services or data stores offered on the Site or (ii) to provide any service that competes with or constitutes a material substitute for the services or data stores offered on the Site; or
attempt to or actually disrupt, impair, or interfere with the Site, or any information, data, or materials posted and/or displayed by SRL; or

7. Teachers and Search Engines
Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, SRL grants the right to teachers to print pages from the Site for distribution to students, provided that proper attribution is given to the URL on the Site where the material originated.

Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, SRL also grant the operators of search engines permission to use robots to copy materials and Content from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indexes of the materials, but not caches, copies, or archives of the materials or Content for any other non-indexing purpose. Search engines are expected to follow the guidelines set forth in the robots.txt file that we provide. For avoidance of doubt, search engines are not permitted to cache, copy, or archive any material or Content from the Site (including without limitation any statistical data) for purposes of offering a competing or substitute product or service to web users. SRL reserves the right to revoke the exceptions granted in this paragraph, either generally or in specific cases, as well as the right to deny service to any user found violating the provisions of this paragraph.

8. Trademarks
All trademarks, service marks, and logos appearing on the Site (the "Marks") are proprietary to SRL or its licensors, except as otherwise indicated herein. By way of illustration, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL®, MLB®, MLB.COM® and associated names, logos, brands, and indicia are registered trademarks of Major League Baseball Properties, LLC. In the United States, baseball team names, logos, brands, and indicia are the property of their respective club owners and designees. The same is also true of the NFL®, NHL®, NBA®, NCAA®, and IOC®. All other Marks not owned by SRL are the property of their respective owners, who may or may not be affiliated with, connected to, or sponsored by SRL. Use or misuse of the Marks without advance written consent from SRL or the respective Mark's owner is expressly prohibited. You shall not use any mark in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers as to source or sponsorship of your goods and services, or in any manner that disparages, tarnishes, dilutes, or discredits SRL. Further, to the extent that third-party Marks used on this Site are the property of their respective owners, any mention on the Site should not be construed as a challenge to said Mark's status or ownership. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
