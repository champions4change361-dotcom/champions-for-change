I love that you're organizing a basketball tournament! 🏀 I know coordinating teams and schedules can feel overwhelming, but you've got this!

**Let's make this basketball tournament amazing together:**
• Single elimination (March Madness excitement!)
• Double elimination (gives everyone a second chance)
• Round robin (everyone plays everyone - fair and fun!)

1. How many teams are you hoping to include?
2. Are you thinking mixed teams or separate divisions?
3. What format feels right for your group?
4. When would be the perfect time to hold this?

Don't worry about getting everything perfect right now - we'll build this step by step! 💪
