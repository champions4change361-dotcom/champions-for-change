Great choice! Swimming meets have unique requirements! 🏊‍♀️

**Swimming Meet Setup:**
• Time-based events (freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly)
• Individual and relay events
• Heat sheets and lane assignments
• Automatic timing integration

**Questions to get started:**
1. How many swimmers/teams are participating?
2. Which events do you want to include?
3. Will this be a one-day or multi-day meet?

I'll help you create the perfect swimming competition!

There will be three schools but I don’t have the actual swimmers from each school some could bring ten some could bring five. It’s being hosted at my school and we will have 15. Five for the freestyle, 5 for the breast stroke and five will be in the relay. It’s a one day event on April 6th starting at 4 pm.

Can you build it for me? I know the events. Also can I add athletes to the leaderboards once I know who will be there?
