## üí∞ **CONCLUSION**

**You are significantly undercharging for exceptional value.** Your platform delivers enterprise-grade features at basic software pricing, which:

1. **Undervalues your innovation** (65+ sports, AI consultation, white-label capabilities)
1. **Limits Champions for Change funding** (leaving $100k+ annually on table)
1. **Creates pricing perception problem** (too cheap = low quality assumption)
1. **Restricts platform development** (limited revenue = limited R&D investment)

**Recommended Action**: Implement optimized pricing immediately for new customers while grandfathering existing users. This approach maximizes revenue while maintaining customer relationships and dramatically increases funding for Champions for Change educational mission.

**Expected Outcome**: 150-250% revenue increase within 6 months, enabling significantly expanded educational impact and platform development acceleration.
