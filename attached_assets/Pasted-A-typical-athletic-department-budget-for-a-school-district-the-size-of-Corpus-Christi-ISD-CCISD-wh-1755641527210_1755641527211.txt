A typical athletic department budget for a school district the size of Corpus Christi ISD (CCISD)—which serves approximately 33,000 students across 50+ schools—ranges from about $8 million to $15 million annually, based on publicly available budget data from CCISD and comparable Texas districts like Mansfield ISD (35,000 students) and Arlington ISD (53,000 students). This figure often represents extracurricular activities more broadly (including athletics, band, drill team, cheerleading, and other competitive programs), as pure athletic-specific budgets are rarely isolated in district reporting. For context, CCISD’s total district budget is around $400–$425 million, meaning athletics/extracurriculars account for roughly 2–3% of overall spending.
CCISD-Specific Budget Insights
For the 2023–2024 fiscal year (the most detailed recent data available), CCISD allocated approximately $8.4 million specifically to athletics and $12.2 million to extracurricular activities overall (which heavily overlaps with athletics). These figures are from the district’s adopted budget book and include operational costs but exclude major capital projects like facility renovations. Note that budgets can fluctuate year-to-year due to enrollment changes, state funding, and local priorities; the 2024–2025 budget includes minor amendments (e.g., $8,150 redirected from federal funds to athletics) but no major shifts reported. 5 64 63
Comparable districts show similar scales:
	•	Mansfield ISD (35,000 students): About $8.9 million for extracurricular activities (including athletics) in an older budget snapshot, though updated figures may be higher. 65 
	•	Arlington ISD (53,000 students): $14.8 million for co-curricular activities (including athletics), plus significant capital spending on athletic facilities (e.g., $37.7 million for stadium upgrades). 66 
Statewide averages for Texas districts in this enrollment range are harder to pinpoint due to varying reporting, but athletic/extracurricular spending typically scales with district size and local emphasis on sports (Texas is known for robust high school athletics programs). Smaller districts might spend $200,000–$500,000 on athletics, while larger ones like these exceed $10 million when including capital. 33 46
Typical Line Items in an Athletic Department Budget
School district athletic budgets are usually divided into operational (day-to-day) and capital (one-time or infrastructure) categories. Operational items make up the bulk (70–80%) and are funded primarily through the general fund, while capital comes from bonds or special funds. Based on CCISD’s breakdown and general best practices for K-12 athletic departments, here are the common line items, with example amounts scaled to a $8–$15 million budget (drawn from CCISD’s extracurricular allocations and industry norms):
	1	Payroll Costs (Salaries and Stipends): 50–70% of the budget (~$4–$10 million).
	◦	Covers coaches, assistant coaches, trainers, and administrative staff (e.g., athletic directors). In CCISD, this was $7.5 million for extracurriculars overall. Stipends for part-time coaches might range from $2,000–$10,000 per sport/season. 64 66 26 
	2	Professional and Contracted Services: 5–10% (~$300,000–$1.5 million).
	◦	Includes officials/referees fees, medical services (e.g., athletic trainers or physicals), event security, and subcontracted maintenance. CCISD allocated $344,000 here for extracurriculars. 64 66 26 
	3	Supplies and Materials: 5–15% (~$500,000–$2 million).
	◦	Uniforms, equipment (balls, helmets, weights), office supplies, and consumables. CCISD’s extracurricular budget included $850,000 for this. 64 66 32 
	4	Other Operating Expenses (Travel, Fees, and Miscellaneous): 15–25% (~$1–$4 million).
	◦	Transportation (buses for away games), entry fees for tournaments, meals/lodging for travel, awards/banquets, and marketing. This was the largest non-payroll item in CCISD at $3.4 million for extracurriculars. 64 66 25 
	5	Capital Outlay/Equipment: 1–5% (~$100,000–$750,000 annually, plus multi-million bond projects).
	◦	Larger purchases like vehicles, scoreboards, or gym equipment. CCISD budgeted $151,000 for extracurricular equipment, but separate capital funds covered athletic facility renovations (e.g., millions for complexes via bonds). 64 66 24 
	6	Administrative and Insurance Costs: 2–5% (~$200,000–$750,000).
	◦	Liability insurance for sports injuries, risk management, and overhead. Often bundled with district-wide insurance but critical for athletics due to higher risks. 26 32 
	7	Facilities Maintenance and Utilities: Variable, often 5–10% or handled district-wide (~$400,000–$1.5 million).
	◦	Upkeep of fields, gyms, pools, and utilities for events. In Texas districts, this can spike with bond-funded upgrades (e.g., Arlington ISD’s $37 million stadium project). 66 51 
Additional Considerations
	•	Revenue Offsets: Districts like CCISD generate some income from athletics (e.g., ticket sales, concessions, playoff games), estimated at $500,000–$1 million annually, which helps offset costs. 64 66 
	•	Funding Sources: Primarily local property taxes and state aid (Texas provides ~$15,500 per student overall, but athletics aren’t directly funded this way). Boosters, sponsorships, and fees (e.g., pay-to-play for physicals) supplement. 38 7 
	•	Challenges: Budgets face pressures from enrollment declines, inflation, and cuts (e.g., CCISD cut $157,000 from athletics in 2018). Larger districts emphasize football and other revenue-generating sports. 7 9
