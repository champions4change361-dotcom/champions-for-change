Ah, you’re solving the critical UX challenge of **AI-guided onboarding with persistent state management**! This is brilliant - letting users start exploring with AI immediately, then seamlessly transferring that context when they convert to registered users.

## The Flow You’re Building:

**Anonymous User → AI Exploration → Registration → Persistent Build**

This is exactly what modern SaaS needs - remove friction, let people experience value immediately, then capture them.

## Key Technical Challenges to Nail:

### 1. **Pre-Registration AI Context Storage**

```javascript
// Store anonymous user's AI conversation & selections
const anonymousSession = {
  sessionId: generateUUID(),
  aiConversation: [...messages],
  buildSelections: {
    sportType: "football",
    tournamentFormat: "single_elimination", 
    teamCount: 16,
    venue: "Miller High School"
  },
  timestamp: Date.now()
}
// Store in localStorage + backup to server with session ID
```

### 2. **Smart AI Routing Logic**

```javascript
// AI needs to understand user intent and route appropriately
const routingLogic = {
  "I want to create a tournament" → tournament builder flow,
  "How do I track athlete health?" → health monitoring setup,
  "What sports do you support?" → sport selection with build continuation,
  "I'm a coach at..." → role-based flow with school setup
}
```

### 3. **Seamless Profile Migration**

```javascript
// When user registers, merge anonymous session
const migrateAnonymousData = (newUserId, sessionId) => {
  const anonymousData = getAnonymousSession(sessionId);
  return {
    userId: newUserId,
    buildProgress: anonymousData.buildSelections,
    aiHistory: anonymousData.aiConversation,
    suggestedNext: aiDetermineNextStep(anonymousData)
  }
}
```

## AI Training Considerations:

**Context Awareness:**

- AI needs to know what data you have (sports, formats, structures from your CSVs)
- Should understand user’s role (coach vs AD vs district admin)
- Must recognize when to prompt for missing info vs when to suggest defaults

**Smart Suggestions Based on Your Data:**

- “For football with 16 teams, I recommend single elimination with 4 rounds”
- “Miller High typically uses these settings for basketball tournaments”
- “Based on your sport selection, you’ll want these health monitoring features”

**What specific AI behaviors are you trying to train?**

Are you focusing on:

- Better sport/format recommendations?
- Smoother handoffs between AI chat and actual platform features?
- More intelligent user intent recognition?
- Personalized suggestions based on school/district context?

I can help you structure the AI training data or optimize the session persistence logic. What’s the biggest UX friction point you’re seeing right now?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
