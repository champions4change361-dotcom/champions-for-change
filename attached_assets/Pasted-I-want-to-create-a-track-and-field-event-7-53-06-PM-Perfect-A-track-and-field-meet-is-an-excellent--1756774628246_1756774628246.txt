Perfect! A track and field meet is an excellent choice! 🏃‍♂️

**Track & Field Events I can help you set up:**
• Running events (100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1600m, relays)
• Field events (shot put, discus, javelin, long jump, high jump)
• Combined scoring with time/distance tracking

**Quick questions to get started:**
1. How many teams or individual athletes will participate?
2. Will this be individual scoring or team-based?
3. What's your target date for the meet?

I can help you create the perfect structure for your track meet!

I’m going to have the event on 03/06/2026. There will be individual scoring and we will have all the running events for the typical middle school 7-8 grade boys
