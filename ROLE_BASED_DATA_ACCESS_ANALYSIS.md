## Data Access Permissions Matrix

| Role | Can Add | Can Modify | Can View | Database Scope |
|------|---------|------------|----------|----------------|
| District Athletic Director | District policies, budgets | All district data | District-wide | Full district database |

## Why This Interface Logic Works

### Cascading Dropdowns Make Sense Because:
1. **Hierarchical Data Structure**: District ‚Üí School ‚Üí Team ‚Üí Athlete follows natural organizational hierarchy
2. **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Users naturally think in this progression
3. **Prevents Errors**: Can't select athletes from wrong school/team
4. **Matches Real-World Workflow**: How administrators actually work

### Checkbox Arrays Make Sense Because:
1. **Bulk Operations**: District administrators need to work with multiple schools/teams simultaneously
2. **Communication**: Coaches need to message multiple players at once
3. **Scheduling**: Athletic directors coordinate multiple teams/events
4. **Resource Allocation**: District trainers manage multiple schools

### Single Dropdowns Make Sense For:
1. **Status Changes**: Game status, injury status, clearance status
2. **View Filtering**: Different ways to view the same data
3. **Simple Selections**: When only one option makes sense

## Implementation Success Factors

### ‚úÖ Perfect Implementations:
- **District Athletic Director**: Manages 12+ schools, needs multi-select for everything
- **District Head Trainer**: Coordinates 8+ trainers across schools
- **School Athletic Director**: Manages 15+ teams across grade levels
- **Coach Dashboards**: Manages 25+ players with various statuses

### üéØ Key Insight:
The more hierarchical responsibility a role has, the more they need cascading dropdowns and checkbox arrays. The more specialized/focused the role, the simpler the interface should be.

This interface logic perfectly matches each role's real-world responsibilities and data access patterns in a district athletic management system.
