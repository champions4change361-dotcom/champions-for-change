# Security Certification Gap Analysis - Multi-State Requirements

## Current Security Certification Status

### National Trend: Universal Security Requirements
**Reality**: SOC II Type 2, ISO 27001, and similar certifications are becoming **standard requirements** for educational technology platforms across ALL states, not just Texas. Most established EdTech companies already have these certifications as baseline business requirements.

### Champions for Change Platform
**Status**: No current third-party security certifications

**Required TX-RAMP Fast Track Certifications (within 24 months):**
- ❌ SOC II Type 2
- ❌ ISO 27001
- ❌ ISO 27017 (Cloud Security)
- ❌ ISO 27018 (Cloud Privacy)
- ❌ CSA STAR
- ❌ FISMA (Not applicable)
- ❌ HITRUST Authorized External Assessor Validated Assessment
- ❌ PCI DSS Qualified Security Assessor Audit Report

### Competitive Analysis - RankOne Sport
**Status**: Likely certified (based on TX-RAMP website presence)

**Probable Certifications:**
- ✅ SOC II Type 2 (Standard for SaaS platforms)
- ✅ ISO 27001 (Enterprise requirement)
- ✅ Possibly ISO 27017/27018 (Cloud-specific)
- ✅ TX-RAMP certified platform status

## Critical Gap Assessment

### Immediate Competitive Disadvantage
1. **Cannot serve ANY major district** without security certifications (nationwide issue)
