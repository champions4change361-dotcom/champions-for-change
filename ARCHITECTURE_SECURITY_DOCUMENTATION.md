## Database Schema & Security Configuration

### Core Security Tables

#### Users Table (Primary Authentication)
```sql
users (
  id: varchar (UUID, Primary Key)
  email: varchar (Unique)
  userRole: enum (14 distinct roles)
  complianceRole: enum (District ‚Üí School ‚Üí Coaching hierarchy)
  organizationId: varchar (Multi-tenant isolation)
  subscriptionPlan: enum (Feature access control)
  hipaaTrainingCompleted: boolean
  ferpaAgreementSigned: boolean
  medicalDataAccess: boolean
  lastComplianceAudit: timestamp
)
```

#### Compliance Audit Log (Security Tracking)
```sql
complianceAuditLog (
  id: varchar (UUID, Primary Key)
  userId: varchar (Foreign Key ‚Üí users.id)
  actionType: enum (data_access, data_modification, export, view, login, permission_change)
  resourceType: enum (student_data, health_data, tournament_data, administrative_data)
  resourceId: varchar (Specific record accessed)
  ipAddress: varchar
  userAgent: text
  complianceNotes: text
  createdAt: timestamp
)
```

#### Role Permissions (Granular Access Control)
```sql
rolePermissions (
  userRole: enum (11 distinct roles from District to Fan level)
  permission: enum (9 specific permissions)
  isAllowed: boolean
)
```

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

**Organizations & Districts**
- Hierarchical organization structure (District ‚Üí School ‚Üí Team)
- Data partitioning by `organizationId` 
- VLC (Venue Location Code) system for athletic facilities
- White-label domain isolation with custom branding

## User Role & Permission Matrix

### 5-Tier Hierarchy System

#### **Tier 1: District Level (Maximum Access)**
- `district_athletic_director` - Full platform access, all schools
- `district_head_athletic_trainer` - District-wide health data access
- `district_athletic_coordinator` - District-wide athletic coordination

#### **Tier 2: School Level (School-Specific Access)**
- `school_athletic_director` - School-specific full access
- `school_athletic_trainer` - School health data + athletic management
- `school_athletic_coordinator` - School athletic coordination

#### **Tier 3: Coaching Level (Team-Specific Access)**
- `head_coach` - Team management + limited health data
- `assistant_coach` - Team support + roster management

#### **Tier 4: Operational Level (Event-Specific Access)**
- `tournament_manager` - Tournament creation + management
- `scorekeeper` - Scoring + results entry only

#### **Tier 5: General Access (Read-Only/Limited)**
- `athlete` - Personal data + team information view
- `fan` - Public results + event information only

### Permission Matrix

| Role | Health Data | Student Data | Tournament Mgmt | Analytics | Admin |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| District AD | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full |

setupAuth(app: Express)
  - Multi-domain OAuth strategy setup
  - Session configuration with PostgreSQL store
  - Cookie security with httpOnly, secure, sameSite
```

#### **Compliance Middleware**
```typescript
// HIPAA compliance for health data
requireHipaaCompliance(req, res, next)
  - Verifies HIPAA training completion
  - Checks medical data access permissions
  - Validates role hierarchy for health access
  - Logs all access attempts with compliance context

// FERPA compliance for student data
requireFerpaCompliance(req, res, next)
  - Verifies FERPA agreement signature
  - Validates organizational affiliation
  - Ensures proper educational context
  - Maintains FERPA audit trail

// Role-based access control
requireComplianceRole(allowedRoles: string[])
  - Validates user role against required roles
  - Provides detailed access denial logging
  - Returns specific error codes for debugging
```

#### **Audit & Monitoring**
```typescript
// Comprehensive data access logging
auditDataAccess(resourceType)
  - Logs all data interactions
  - Tracks resource-specific access patterns
  - Maintains IP address and user agent logs
  - Provides compliance report generation

// Real-time security monitoring
logComplianceAction(userId, actionType, resourceType, resourceId, req, notes)
