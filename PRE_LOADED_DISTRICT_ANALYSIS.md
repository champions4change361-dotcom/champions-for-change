## Recommendation:

**ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE INVESTMENT**

The storage costs are negligible ($3/year for all 5 districts). The real cost is research time, but with revenue potential of $37,460/year from just these 5 districts, the ROI is extraordinary.

**Suggested Approach:**
1. Start with Corpus Christi ISD (known quantity)
2. Add Houston ISD (local Texas presence)  
3. Research and pre-load other major districts
4. Use pre-loaded districts as sales demos
5. "Sign up and your tournaments are ready tomorrow"

This creates an unbeatable competitive advantage - instant deployment vs. weeks of competitor setup time.
