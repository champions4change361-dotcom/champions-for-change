# Tournament Bracket Manager

## Overview
This platform is a white-label SaaS solution for the Champions for Change nonprofit, aiming to generate funding for educational opportunities for underprivileged youth. It serves as a comprehensive district academic and athletic management platform, covering all 50+ UIL competitions. Its core purpose is to provide professional tournament management and district-wide administration services. Key capabilities include HIPAA/FERPA compliant data management, tournament creation, scheduling, enterprise-grade compliance, role-based access controls, comprehensive audit trails, user authentication, AI-powered tournament creation, custom branding, and a multi-tenant architecture with an expanded role hierarchy from district to student level. The platform enables full management of student health and educational data, emphasizing its mission-driven approach alongside data protection and regulatory compliance for educational institutions.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Mission-focused: Platform serves Champions for Change nonprofit to fund student trips and educational opportunities for underprivileged youth.
Branding: Green and blue color scheme from Champions for Change logo, emphasis on educational impact and coach-built heritage.
Domain Strategy: Primary domain will be championsforchange.net hosted on Replit. All existing business cards and QR codes should redirect seamlessly to the new Replit-hosted tournament platform.
Transparency Policy: Absolute commitment to honest marketing - no fake reviews, testimonials, or misleading claims. Platform will earn authentic reviews through real user experiences.
Competitive Strategy: Mission-driven advantage - "Let them copy, they'll always be behind and can't replicate the authentic educational mission."
District Value Proposition: At $4,500-5,000/year, districts save $26,000+ annually compared to current solutions while supporting educational mission. ROI still massive and fiscally irresponsible not to adopt. Districts handle student fees through existing systems - no payment processing burden on platform.
Tournament Organizer Pricing: $39/month ($468/year) or $399/year (2 months free) - competitive with Jersey Watch + Challonge combined.
Business Enterprise Pricing: $149/month or $1,499/year (2 months free) for flexible enterprise solutions.
Guaranteed Pricing Model: "The price you pay at the time is the price you always pay" - creates permanent cost advantage for early adopters and eliminates budget uncertainty.
White Label Strategy: Remove from initial offering to simplify market entry. Add later with 50-100% price increase. Focus on "Professional Platform" with logo, colors, custom domain.
Organization Expansion: Include charter schools, private schools, pony leagues, pop warner, and youth organizations with dedicated registration path alongside districts.

- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS.
- **Custom Design System**: Extensive use of CSS variables for consistent theming and dark mode support. Integrated custom Tailwind extensions (colors, animations, spacing). Preference for custom React components with variants (CustomCard, CustomButton, AnimatedText, FloatingElement). Design patterns include glass morphism, gradients, floating animations, and glow effects. Tournament-themed color system in HSL format. CSS-based animations with custom keyframes. Mobile-first responsive design with improved navigation system for CCISD VLC schools access and proper content spacing.
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **Component Structure**: Modular design for UI, pages, and business logic.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.

- **Development Setup**: Vite integration with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based system supporting in-memory and database implementations.
- **Health Checks**: Optimized deployment health check endpoints.
- **Deployment Ready**: Enhanced error handling, multiple health check endpoints, robust process error handling, and production-mode stability features.

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database for serverless PostgreSQL.
- **Fallback Storage**: In-memory storage.
