## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Mission-focused: Platform serves Champions for Change nonprofit to fund student trips and educational opportunities for underprivileged youth.
Branding: Green and blue color scheme from Champions for Change logo, emphasis on educational impact and coach-built heritage.
Domain Strategy: Primary domain www.championsforchange.net DEPLOYED on Replit (verification in progress). Transfer code from Jersey Watch (%eRUvQT-jvI0Q4oQ{386). All existing business cards and QR codes will redirect seamlessly to the Replit-hosted tournament platform.
Transparency Policy: Absolute commitment to honest marketing - no fake reviews, testimonials, or misleading claims. Platform will earn authentic reviews through real user experiences.
Competitive Strategy: Mission-driven advantage - "Let them copy, they'll always be behind and can't replicate the authentic educational mission."
Enterprise Equality Philosophy: All organizations receive the same enterprise-level capabilities regardless of size or budget. Pricing differentiated by volume limits and support level, never by feature quality. Small districts get identical enterprise features as large districts. Small businesses get identical enterprise features as large corporations.
Organization Categories: Clear distinction between Private Schools (independent institutions with flexible security requirements), Community Nonprofits (churches, Boys & Girls Clubs with tournament organizing needs), and Business Enterprise (white-label platform providers). Public school districts and charter schools represent future market expansion after security certifications are completed.
Independent School Pro: $199/month - Up to 500 students, full athletic management suite, academic competition tracking, AI injury prediction, health communication, equipment management, smart scheduling, and basic support. Perfect for mid-size private schools.

Annual Pro: $990/month - High-volume tournament companies (50+ tournaments/year) with unlimited capacity and enhanced support.
Guaranteed Pricing Model: "The price you pay at the time is the price you always pay" - creates permanent cost advantage for early adopters and eliminates budget uncertainty.
White Label Strategy: Remove from initial offering to simplify market entry. Add later with 50-100% price increase. Focus on "Professional Platform" with logo, colors, custom domain.
Organization Expansion: Include charter schools, private schools, pony leagues, pop warner, and youth organizations with dedicated registration path alongside districts.
