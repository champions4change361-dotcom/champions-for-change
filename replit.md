# Tournament Bracket Manager

## Overview

This is a full-stack tournament bracket management application that allows users to create and manage single-elimination tournaments with interactive bracket visualization and real-time match updates. The application features a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence and in-memory storage as a fallback.

**Status**: Fully functional with comprehensive Bubble database integration. System includes import functionality for 59+ sports, 30+ tournament formats, and track events. Features interactive bracket management with team name editing and complete tournament lifecycle management.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling
- **Component Structure**: Modular component architecture with separate UI components, pages, and business logic components

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured error handling and request logging middleware
- **Development Setup**: Vite integration for development with HMR support
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based storage system supporting both in-memory and database implementations

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless) for serverless PostgreSQL
- **Fallback Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for development/testing
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type validation and Drizzle-Zod integration

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)
- **Security**: CORS configuration and secure session handling
- **Note**: Authentication endpoints not yet implemented but session infrastructure is in place

### External Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Icons**: Font Awesome and Lucide React icons
- **Development**: Replit-specific development tools and error handling
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation across frontend and backend
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation utilities

### Key Design Patterns
- **Shared Schema**: Common TypeScript types and Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend
- **Repository Pattern**: Storage abstraction allowing for multiple storage implementations
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling and behavior
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with runtime validation using Zod
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Fallback storage system ensures application works without database connection
- **Data Integration**: Bubble database import system with comprehensive sports and tournament structure support
- **Interactive Bracket Management**: Real-time team name editing and match progression with visual feedback
