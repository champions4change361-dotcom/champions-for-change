Small businesses get identical enterprise features as large corporations.
Organization Categories: Clear distinction between Private Schools (independent institutions with flexible security requirements), Community Nonprofits (churches, Boys & Girls Clubs with tournament organizing needs), and Business Enterprise (white-label platform providers).
