## Current Status: Site is Live but District Access Issues

The domain trantortournaments.org is responding correctly (HTTP 200), but school district firewalls may be blocking access.

## School District Network Restrictions

### Common Blocks
1. **Educational Content Filters**: Districts block sites not categorized as "educational"
2. **New Domain Restrictions**: Recently purchased domains flagged as "uncategorized"
3. **External Platform Blocks**: Replit deployments may be blocked by security policies
4. **SSL Certificate Issues**: Some districts require specific certificate authorities

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Request District Whitelist
Contact your district IT department to whitelist:
- **Domain**: trantortournaments.org
- **Purpose**: Educational tournament management for Champions for Change nonprofit
- **Category**: Educational/Sports Management
- **Content**: Youth-safe tournament brackets and scoring

### Solution 2: Use Alternative Access Methods
While waiting for whitelist approval:

#### Mobile Hotspot Access
