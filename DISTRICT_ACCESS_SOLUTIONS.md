- Waste $30,000-65,000 annually on inferior solutions
- Frustrate coaches, parents, and students with outdated processes  
- Miss opportunities for community engagement and revenue growth
- Ignore their social responsibility to support educational equity

**The question isn't whether districts can afford Champions District.**
