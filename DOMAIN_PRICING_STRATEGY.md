## Key Strategic Insight

**"Let them copy the features, they can't replicate the authentic educational mission."**

This pricing strategy leverages Champions for Change's unique position as a mission-driven platform. Competitors can copy tournament management features, but they cannot replicate the authentic educational impact and community-driven approach that justifies premium pricing and drives user loyalty.
