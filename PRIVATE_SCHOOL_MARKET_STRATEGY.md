# Private School Market Strategy - Certification Exceptions & Advantages

## Key Research Findings: Private Schools vs Charter Schools

### Private Schools - Major Advantage
**FERPA Compliance**: Private schools are generally **NOT subject to FERPA** at K-12 level (rarely receive federal funding)
- **No federal student data protection mandates**
- **More flexibility in vendor selection** without federal funding restrictions
- **Reduced compliance burden** compared to public institutions
- **Can choose security frameworks based purely on business needs**

### Charter Schools - Similar to Public Schools
**FERPA Compliance**: Charter schools are generally **subject to FERPA** (receive federal funding)

- May need additional certifications for specific state contracts
- Full FERPA compliance required

## Private School Certification Requirements

### Security Certification Reality
**Good News**: Private schools have **significant exceptions** to strict certification requirements:

1. **No Federal Mandates**: Not subject to federal procurement rules requiring SOC II/ISO 27001
2. **Flexible Standards**: Can assess vendor security through questionnaires vs requiring formal certifications
3. **Business-Driven Decisions**: Security choices based on institutional needs, not regulatory compliance
4. **Cost-Conscious**: More willing to work with emerging platforms that demonstrate strong security practices

### What Private Schools Actually Require

**Common Requirements**:
