# Private School Market Strategy - Realistic Pricing Structure

## Issue Identified
Landing page included "Champions District" pricing for up to 15 schools, which is unrealistic for the private school market. Private school "districts" with 15 schools are extremely rare and don't represent a meaningful market segment.

## Market Reality Analysis

### Private School Structure
- **Individual Schools**: Most private schools operate as single institutions
- **Small Networks**: Some religious organizations operate 2-4 schools
- **Large Networks**: Very rare - typically major Catholic dioceses or elite prep school systems
- **15+ School Networks**: Essentially non-existent in private school market

### Charter School Reality
- **Independent Charters**: Single school operations (most common)
- **Charter Networks**: 2-8 schools (growing segment)
- **Large Networks**: KIPP, Success Academy, etc. (rare but significant)
- **15+ School Networks**: Limited to major national operators

## Revised Pricing Strategy

### Core Pricing Tiers (Private School Focused)

**1. Educational Partnership - $99/month**
- Target: Schools under 200 students
- Perfect for: Small religious schools, Montessori schools, specialty programs
- Value Proposition: Enterprise features at affordable pricing

**2. Independent School Pro - $199/month**  
- Target: 200-500 students (most private schools)
- Perfect for: Mid-size private schools, established programs
- Value Proposition: Full athletic management suite with AI features

**3. Champions Level - $399/month**
- Target: 500-1,500 students (large private schools)
- Perfect for: Elite prep schools, large charter networks, major religious schools
- Value Proposition: Complete enterprise platform with custom branding

**4. Tournament Organizer - $39/month**
- Target: Community organizations
- Perfect for: Churches, youth leagues, nonprofits
- Value Proposition: Tournament management without school administration

**5. Business Enterprise - $149/month**
- Target: Commercial organizations
- Perfect for: Tournament companies, sports businesses
- Value Proposition: White-label capabilities

### Removed Unrealistic Tiers
- ❌ **Champions District ($2,490/year)**: No market demand for 15-school private networks
- ❌ **District Enterprise ($4,500/year)**: Public school pricing that doesn't apply to private market
